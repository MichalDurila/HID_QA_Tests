# HID_QA_Tests
Contains the test harness with the test cases to test the library `hash.dll` from the `HID_QA_Homework` repository.

To run the Test Suite with the defined Test Cases, please, run the `main.py`, e.g. by running a command
```
C:\Python313_32bit\python.exe test.py
```
in the Windows command line opened in a folder, in which `main.py` is saved.
It will generate a test report named `test_report.txt` and save it into this folder.

Note, that some 32-bit version of the Python language shall be installed in Your computer.
We tested it with Python 3.13.0 installed in the folder `C:\Python313_32bit`.
